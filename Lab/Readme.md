These are my Lab Programs for Python subject 

<h3>List of Programs:</h3>

1. Write and run a program<br>
  a. To elaborate variables and their data types such as int, float, boolean, string, list, set, dictionary and tuples; exchange of two values.
  b. To elaborate mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulo, and power; also explore the operator precedence.

2. Write programs to implement conditional operations on following:
  a. Python program to find the sum and average of natural numbers up to n where n is provided by user.
  b. Python program to find factorial, and Fibonacci of a number, received by user, with iterative as well as recursive process.

3. Write python programs
  a. To print all prime number in a series
  b. To find largest among three numbers, input by user.
  c. To find HCF for two numbers, input by user

4. Write python program
  a. To shuffle a deck of cards using module random and draw 8 cards
  b. To display calendar of selected month and year by a user
  c. To solve the quadratic equation ax**2 + bx + c = 0.

5. Write python program to elaborate strings such as
  a. String declaration, traversing, slicing, concatenating, and sorting in a list.
  b. To check whether a string is palindrome or not; to remove punctuations from a string.

6. Write python program
  a. To elaborate lists with the operations such as creating, navigating, slicing, adding or removing elements, etc.
  b. To elaborate tuples with the operations as in above assignment.
  c. To elaborate dictionaries with the operations such as given above.

7. Write Python program using NumPy
  a. To find the addition of two matrices
  b. To find the product of two matrices
  c. To find the transpose of a matrix

8. Write python program using Pandas
  a. To handle missing values in a dataset.
  b. To remove duplicate values in a dataset.
  c. To count the NaN values in a dataset.

9. Write Python program
  a. To elaborate file operations such as, opening a file, reading from it, writing into it, closing it, and various file methods.
  b. To elaborate file and directory management such as creating a directory, renaming it, listing all directories and working with them.
  c. To elaborate exception handing with python built in commands such as try, except, and finally.

10. Write python program
  a. To read from a CSV file of the given data using ‘pandas’ library.
  b. For the given data, plot the scatter matrix for males only. Explain about 2 sub-populations’ correspondence to gender.
  c. For the given data, using python environment, apply 1-sample t-test: testing the value of population mean.
  d. For the given data, using python environment, apply 2-sample t-test: testing for difference across the population.

11. Write python program to show following plots using Matplotlib library.
  a. To create a pie chart of the popularity of programming Languages
  b. To create bar plot of scores by group and gender. Use multiple X values on the same chart for men and women.
  c. To draw a scatter plot comparing two subject marks.

12. Write python programs for following graphical objects
  a. Draw the target symbol (a set of concentric squares, alternating red and white) in a graphics window, that is, 200 pixels wide by 200 pixels high. 
  (Hint: Draw the target square first in red, followed by next smaller square in white, then draw the next smaller square in red).
  b. Create a 5x5 rectangle whose top left corner is at (row*5, col*5). If the sum of the rows and columns’ number is even, set the fill color of the rectangle to white,
  otherwise set it to the black. Then draw the rectangle.
