These are my Lab Programs for Python subject 

<h3>List of Programs:</h3>

1. Write and run a program
  <br>a. To elaborate variables and their data types such as int, float, boolean, string, list, set, dictionary and tuples; exchange of two values.
  <br>b. To elaborate mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulo, and power; also explore the operator precedence.

2. Write programs to implement conditional operations on following:
  <br>a. Python program to find the sum and average of natural numbers up to n where n is provided by user.
  <br>b. Python program to find factorial, and Fibonacci of a number, received by user, with iterative as well as recursive process.

3. Write python programs
  <br>a. To print all prime number in a series
  <br>b. To find largest among three numbers, input by user.
  <br>c. To find HCF for two numbers, input by user

4. Write python program
  <br>a. To shuffle a deck of cards using module random and draw 8 cards
  <br>b. To display calendar of selected month and year by a user
  <br>c. To solve the quadratic equation ax**2 + bx + c = 0.

5. Write python program to elaborate strings such as
  <br>a. String declaration, traversing, slicing, concatenating, and sorting in a list.
  <br>b. To check whether a string is palindrome or not; to remove punctuations from a string.

6. Write python program
  <br>a. To elaborate lists with the operations such as creating, navigating, slicing, adding or removing elements, etc.
  <br>b. To elaborate tuples with the operations as in above assignment.
  <br>c. To elaborate dictionaries with the operations such as given above.

7. Write Python program using NumPy
  <br>a. To find the addition of two matrices
  <br>b. To find the product of two matrices
  <br>c. To find the transpose of a matrix

8. Write python program using Pandas
  <br>a. To handle missing values in a dataset.
  <br>b. To remove duplicate values in a dataset.
  <br>c. To count the NaN values in a dataset.

9. Write Python program
  <br>a. To elaborate file operations such as, opening a file, reading from it, writing into it, closing it, and various file methods.
  <br>b. To elaborate file and directory management such as creating a directory, renaming it, listing all directories and working with them.
  <br>c. To elaborate exception handing with python built in commands such as try, except, and finally.

10. Write python program
  <br>a. To read from a CSV file of the given data using ‘pandas’ library.
  <br>b. For the given data, plot the scatter matrix for males only. Explain about 2 sub-populations’ correspondence to gender.
  <br>c. For the given data, using python environment, apply 1-sample t-test: testing the value of population mean.
  <br>d. For the given data, using python environment, apply 2-sample t-test: testing for difference across the population.

11. Write python program to show following plots using Matplotlib library.
  <br>a. To create a pie chart of the popularity of programming Languages
  <br>b. To create bar plot of scores by group and gender. Use multiple X values on the same chart for men and women.
  <br>c. To draw a scatter plot comparing two subject marks.

12. Write python programs for following graphical objects
  <br>a. Draw the target symbol (a set of concentric squares, alternating red and white) in a graphics window, that is, 200 pixels wide by 200 pixels high. 
  <br>(Hint: Draw the target square first in red, followed by next smaller square in white, then draw the next smaller square in red).
  <br>b. Create a 5x5 rectangle whose top left corner is at (row*5, col*5). If the sum of the rows and columns’ number is even, set the fill color of the rectangle to white,
  <br>otherwise set it to the black. Then draw the rectangle.
